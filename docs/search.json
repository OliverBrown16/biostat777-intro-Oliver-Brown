Which features appear to be the most strongly associated with a higher price?\n\n\nThe Audience\nThis analysis is towards students in the beginning of their journey in data science. It serves as an introductory example of exploratory data analysis, demonstrating how to move from a raw dataset to a conclusion.\n\n\nThe Data\nWe are using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset, which was compiled by Dean De Cock in 2011 for use in data science education (De Cock 2011). It provides a rich alternative to the ethically-compromised Boston Housing dataset.\nThe data is publicly available and is packaged in the AmesHousing R package (Cock 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA public domain map of Ames, Iowa"

    "text": "2. Data Setup and Wrangling\n\nData Dictionary\nFirst, we load the necessary packages and the data. This analysis relies heavily on the tidyverse suite of packages for data wrangling and visualization (Wickham et al. 2019). We will also use the AmesHousing package to load the ames_raw dataset.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AmesHousing)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n\n\nNext, we’ll load the raw data and apply our wrangling pipeline. This includes selecting our five columns of interest (sale price, above-ground living area, overall quality, neighborhood, and year sold), renaming them for clarity, filtering out any rows with missing data, modifying the overall quality column into an ordered factor, and creating one new variable for price per square foot.\n\n\nA Note on Feature Engineering\nCreating new variables from existing ones, like we did with price_per_sq_ft, is a practice called feature engineering. This new variable can sometimes reveal patterns that are not obvious from the original data alone.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: wrangle-data\n\ndata(ames_raw, package = \"AmesHousing\")\n\names_clean &lt;- ames_raw %&gt;%\n  select(\n    `SalePrice`, \n    `Gr Liv Area`, \n    `Overall Qual`, \n    `Neighborhood`, \n    `Yr Sold`\n  ) %&gt;% \n  rename( \n    sale_price = `SalePrice`,\n    living_area = `Gr Liv Area`,\n    overall_quality = `Overall Qual`,\n    neighborhood = `Neighborhood`,\n    year_sold = `Yr Sold`\n  ) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(sale_price)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    overall_quality = factor(\n      overall_quality, \n      levels = 1:10, \n      ordered = TRUE\n    ),\n    price_per_sq_ft = sale_price / living_area\n  )\n\nhead(ames_clean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  sale_price living_area overall_quality neighborhood year_sold price_per_sq_ft\n       &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     215000        1656 6               NAmes             2010            130.\n2     105000         896 5               NAmes             2010            117.\n3     172000        1329 6               NAmes             2010            129.\n4     244000        2110 7               NAmes             2010            116.\n5     189900        1629 5               Gilbert           2010            117.\n6     195500        1604 6               Gilbert           2010            122.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, we are using only a small subset of all variables available. If we were to create a full regression model of sale price, we would consider all variables, such as kitchen quality, basement quality, and garage size.\n\n\nTo get a quick overview, let’s create a summary table of the top 5 most expensive neighborhoods by average sale price. We do this by grouping our clean data by neighborhood, calculating the averages, and sorting the list.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: summary-table\n\nneighborhood_summary &lt;- ames_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(neighborhood) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),\n    mean_price_per_sq_ft = mean(price_per_sq_ft, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count = n()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(mean_sale_price))\n\nhead(neighborhood_summary, 5)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  neighborhood mean_sale_price mean_price_per_sq_ft count\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 NoRidge              330319.                 132.    71\n2 StoneBr              324229.                 166.    51\n3 NridgHt              322018.                 166.   166\n4 GrnHill              280000                  199.     2\n5 Veenker              248315.                 143.    24"

First, we’ll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between living area and sale price, coloring the dots by overall quality.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(ames_clean, \n       aes(x = living_area, y = sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = overall_quality), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sale Price vs. Above-Ground Living Area\",\n    subtitle = \"Price increases with living area; color shows overall quality rating.\",\n    x = \"Living Area (Square Feet)\",\n    y = \"Sale Price (USD)\",\n    color = \"Overall Quality\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: AmesHousing R Package\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, to see how quality impacts the distribution of prices, we’ll use a boxplot.

    "text": "4. Summary\nOur analysis of the Ames, Iowa housing data confirms strong and intuitive relationships between home features and price. We found that both above-ground living area and overall quality are powerful drivers of a home’s final sale price. Our visualizations clearly show that as a home’s size and quality rating increase, its median sale price also tends to increase. This was particularly evident in the boxplot, which showed a clear step-up in median price with each quality point. Furthermore, by examining the market from 2006-2010, we observed a slight dip in price after 2007, with the median dropping from a high of $$$165k in 2007 to $$$155k in 2010, and with further analysis, we can see if this difference in median price is significant or not. While this exploratory analysis focused on only a few key variables, it sets a clear foundation for a more complex predictive model that would likely incorporate other factors to improve accuracy."
