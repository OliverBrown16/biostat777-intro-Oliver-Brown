This includes selecting our five columns of interest (sale price, above-ground living area, overall quality, neighborhood, and year sold), renaming them for clarity, filtering out any rows with missing data, modifying the overall quality column into an ordered factor, and creating one new variable for price per square foot.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: wrangle-data\n\ndata(ames_raw, package = \"AmesHousing\")\n\names_clean &lt;- ames_raw %&gt;%\n  select(\n    `SalePrice`, \n    `Gr Liv Area`, \n    `Overall Qual`, \n    `Neighborhood`, \n    `Yr Sold`\n  ) %&gt;% \n  rename( \n    sale_price = `SalePrice`,\n    living_area = `Gr Liv Area`,\n    overall_quality = `Overall Qual`,\n    neighborhood = `Neighborhood`,\n    year_sold = `Yr Sold`\n  ) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(sale_price)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    overall_quality = factor(\n      overall_quality, \n      levels = 1:10, \n      ordered = TRUE\n    ),\n    price_per_sq_ft = sale_price / living_area\n  )\n\nhead(ames_clean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  sale_price living_area overall_quality neighborhood year_sold price_per_sq_ft\n       &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     215000        1656 6               NAmes             2010            130.\n2     105000         896 5               NAmes             2010            117.\n3     172000        1329 6               NAmes             2010            129.\n4     244000        2110 7               NAmes             2010            116.\n5     189900        1629 5               Gilbert           2010            117.\n6     195500        1604 6               Gilbert           2010            122.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, we are using only a small subset of all variables available. If we were to create a full regression model of sale price, we would consider all variables, such as kitchen quality, basement quality, and garage size.\n\n\nTo get a quick overview, let’s create a summary table of the top 5 most expensive neighborhoods by average sale price.

    "text": "3. Data Visualization and Analysis\nNow we can start plotting. First, we’ll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between living area and sale price, coloring the dots by overall quality.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: plot-scatter\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 5\n\nggplot(ames_clean, \n       aes(x = living_area, y = sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = overall_quality), alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sale Price vs. Above-Ground Living Area\",\n    subtitle = \"Price increases with living area; color shows overall quality rating.\",\n    x = \"Living Area (Square Feet)\",\n    y = \"Sale Price (USD)\",\n    color = \"Overall Quality\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: AmesHousing R Package\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, to see how quality impacts the distribution of prices, we’ll use a boxplot. This shows the median and spread of sale prices for each of the 10 quality ratings.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: plot-boxplot\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 5\n\nggplot(ames_clean, aes(x = overall_quality, y = sale_price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = overall_quality), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Sale Price by Overall Quality\",\n    subtitle = \"Median sale price (the line in the box) increases significantly with quality.\",\n    x = \"Overall Quality Rating (1=Very Poor, 10=Very Excellent)\",\n    y = \"Sale Price (USD)\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: AmesHousing R Package\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the quality levels on the tail ends (like “Very Poor” and “Very Excellent”) have far fewer data points than the levels in the middle. Because of this smaller sample size, the median shown for these categories are less reliable estimates than those for the more common, central quality ratings.\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how the overall market changed over time. We’ll use a histogram and facet the plot by year to create separate price distribution charts for each year in the data.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: plot-histogram-facet\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 6\n\nmedian_prices &lt;- ames_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(year_sold) %&gt;%\n  summarize(median_price = median(sale_price)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    median_label = scales::label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = \"k\")(median_price)\n  )\n\nggplot(ames_clean, aes(x = sale_price)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(fill = after_stat(count)), \n    bins = 50, \n    show.legend = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.7 \n  ) +\n  \n  geom_vline(\n    data = median_prices,\n    aes(xintercept = median_price),\n    color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    linewidth = 0.7\n  ) +\n  \n  geom_text(\n    data = median_prices,\n    aes(\n      x = median_price + 9000, \n      label = median_label\n    ),\n    y = 90, \n    color = \"red\",\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = 0 \n  ) +\n  \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = \"k\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ year_sold) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Home Sale Prices by Year\",\n    subtitle = \"The median price (red line) appears to have shifted downward during the Great Recession.\",\n    x = \"Sale Price (USD)\",\n    y = \"Number of Homes Sold\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: AmesHousing R Package\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) +\n  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500000))"
