This page demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. We will explore features of homes to understand their relationship with the final sale price.

## 1. Introduction

### The Question

What is the relationship between a home's physical characteristics (like overall quality) and its final sale price? Which features appear to be the most strongly associated with a higher price?

### The Audience

This analysis is towards students in the beginning of their journey in data science. It serves as an introductory example of exploratory data analysis, demonstrating how to move from a raw dataset to a conclusion.

### The Data

We are using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset, which was compiled by **Dean De Cock in 2011** for use in data science education [@DeCock2011]. It provides a rich alternative to the ethically-compromised Boston Housing dataset.

The data is publicly available and is packaged in the `AmesHousing` R package [@AmesHousing].

## 2. Data Setup and Wrangling

### Data Dictionary

First, we load the necessary packages and the data. This analysis relies heavily on the `tidyverse` collection of packages for wrangling and visualization of data [@wickham2019welcome]. We will also use the `AmesHousing` package to load the `ames_raw` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(AmesHousing)
library(scales)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

```

Next, we'll load the raw data and apply our wrangling pipeline. This includes selecting our five columns of interest (sale price, above-ground living area, overall quality, neighborhood, and year sold), renaming them for clarity, filtering out any rows with missing data, modifying the overall quality column into an ordered factor, and creating one new variable for price per square foot.

:::{.column-margin}
**A Note on Feature Engineering**

Creating new variables from existing ones, like we did with `price_per_sq_ft`, is a practice called *feature engineering*. This new variable can sometimes reveal patterns that are not obvious from the original data alone.
:::

```{r}

#| label: wrangle-data

data(ames_raw, package = "AmesHousing")

ames_clean <- ames_raw %>%
  select(
    `SalePrice`, 
    `Gr Liv Area`, 
    `Overall Qual`, 
    `Neighborhood`, 
    `Yr Sold`
  ) %>% 
  rename( 
    sale_price = `SalePrice`,
    living_area = `Gr Liv Area`,
    overall_quality = `Overall Qual`,
    neighborhood = `Neighborhood`,
    year_sold = `Yr Sold`
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sale_price)) %>%
  mutate(
    overall_quality = factor(
      overall_quality, 
      levels = 1:10, 
      ordered = TRUE
    ),
    price_per_sq_ft = sale_price / living_area
  )

head(ames_clean)

```

:::{.callout-note}
For simplicity, we are using only a small subset of all variables available. If we were to create a full regression model of sale price, we would consider all variables, such as kitchen quality, basement quality, and garage size.
:::

To get a quick overview, let's create a summary table of the top 5 most expensive neighborhoods by average sale price. We do this by grouping our clean data by neighborhood, calculating the averages, and sorting the list.

```{r}

#| label: summary-table

neighborhood_summary <- ames_clean %>%
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_sale_price = mean(sale_price),
    mean_price_per_sq_ft = mean(price_per_sq_ft, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_sale_price))

head(neighborhood_summary, 5)

```

## 3. Data Visualization and Analysis

Now we can start plotting. First, we'll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between living area and sale price, coloring the dots by overall quality.

```{r}

ggplot(ames_clean, 
       aes(x = living_area, y = sale_price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = overall_quality), alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    title = "Sale Price vs. Above-Ground Living Area",
    subtitle = "Price increases with living area; color shows overall quality rating.",
    x = "Living Area (Square Feet)",
    y = "Sale Price (USD)",
    color = "Overall Quality",
    caption = "Data Source: AmesHousing R Package"
  )

```

Next, to see how quality impacts the distribution of prices, we'll use a boxplot. This shows the median and spread of sale prices for each of the 10 quality ratings.

```{r}



ggplot(ames_clean, aes(x = overall_quality, y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = overall_quality), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Sale Price by Overall Quality",
    subtitle = "Median sale price (the line in the box) increases significantly with quality.",
    x = "Overall Quality Rating (1=Very Poor, 10=Very Excellent)",
    y = "Sale Price (USD)",
    caption = "Data Source: AmesHousing R Package"
  )

```

::: {.callout-note}
Note that the quality levels on the tail ends (like "Very Poor" and "Very Excellent") have far fewer data points than the levels in the middle. Because of this smaller sample size, the median shown for these categories are less reliable estimates than those for the more common, central quality ratings.
:::

Finally, let's see how the overall market changed over time. We'll use a histogram and facet the plot by year to create separate price distribution charts for each year in the data.

```{r}

median_prices <- ames_clean %>%
  group_by(year_sold) %>%
  summarize(median_price = median(sale_price)) %>%
  mutate(
    median_label = scales::label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "k")(median_price)
  )

ggplot(ames_clean, aes(x = sale_price)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(fill = after_stat(count)), 
    bins = 50, 
    show.legend = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7 
  ) +
  
  geom_vline(
    data = median_prices,
    aes(xintercept = median_price),
    color = "red",
    linetype = "dashed",
    linewidth = 0.7
  ) +
  
  geom_text(
    data = median_prices,
    aes(
      x = median_price + 9000, 
      label = median_label
    ),
    y = 90, 
    color = "red",
    size = 3,
    hjust = 0 
  ) +
  
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "k")) +
  facet_wrap(~ year_sold) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Home Sale Prices by Year",
    subtitle = "The median price (red line) appears to have shifted downward during the Great Recession.",
    x = "Sale Price (USD)",
    y = "Number of Homes Sold",
    caption = "Data Source: AmesHousing R Package"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) +
  
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500000))

```

## 4. Summary

Our analysis of the Ames, Iowa housing data confirms strong and intuitive relationships between home features and price. We found that both above-ground living area and overall quality are powerful drivers of a home's final sale price. Our visualizations clearly show that as a home's size and quality rating increase, its median sale price also tends to increase. This was particularly evident in the boxplot, which showed a clear step-up in median price with each quality point. Furthermore, by examining the market from 2006-2010, we observed a slight dip in price after 2007, with the median dropping from a high of $\$$165k in 2007 to $\$$155k in 2010, and with further analysis, we can see if this difference in median price is significant or not. While this exploratory analysis focused on only a few key variables, it sets a clear foundation for a more complex predictive model that would likely incorporate other factors to improve accuracy.
